## 🧪 Analyzer Logic (Rule-Based)

SMCA uses deterministic, transparent rules to evaluate:

- Caption length (too short / too long / ideal)
- Hashtag count and quality
- Presence of CTA (comment, share, follow, etc.)
- Emoji balance
- Basic sentiment indicators
- Readability hints (long words)
- Engagement boosters (questions)

This ensures predictable output and easy evaluation.

## 📝 200-Word Write-Up (Ready for Submission)

This Social Media Content Analyzer is designed to extract, interpret, and enhance social-media content using clean, production-ready engineering practices. The application processes PDF files using `pdf-parse` and handles image-based text extraction through in-browser OCR using `Tesseract.js`, offering a fast and lightweight solution that avoids server-load overhead. The extracted text is analyzed through a deterministic, rule-based engine that evaluates caption length, emoji usage, hashtag relevance, call-to-action presence, readability, sentiment cues, and engagement triggers. This ensures clear and explainable outputs suitable for both technical assessments and real-world usability.

The project uses a minimal tech stack for easy deployment, consisting of Node.js, Express.js, and vanilla frontend technologies. The interface is fully responsive, user-friendly, and enriched with progress indicators, copy/download features, and a clean card-based layout. The application follows all assignment submission guidelines, including proper project structure, removal of unnecessary dependencies, and a polished README for review. Overall, the solution balances engineering clarity, thoughtful UI/UX, efficient text processing, and practical insights — making it both assessment-ready and readily expandable.
